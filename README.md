# Model Overview
This repository contains the code for UNETR: Transformers for 3D Medical Image Segmentation [1]. UNETR is the first 3D segmentation network that uses a pure vision transformer as its encoder without relying on CNNs for feature extraction.
The code presents a volumetric (3D) multi-organ segmentation application using the BTCV challenge dataset.
